<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Stainless Steel Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monofilament Steel Suture</li><li>Multifilament Steel Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical stainless steel suture market primarily consists of two types: monofilament and multifilament steel sutures. Monofilament steel sutures are composed of a single strand, offering smooth passage through tissue and reduced likelihood of infection. They provide excellent tensile strength but may be less flexible. In contrast, multifilament steel sutures are made of multiple threads twisted together, enhancing flexibility and knot security. These sutures are typically more comfortable for the patient but can have higher friction and potential for bacteria harboring.</p></p>
