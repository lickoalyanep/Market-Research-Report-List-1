<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glenoid Cavity Prostheses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented</li><li>Cementless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glenoid cavity prostheses market is categorized into cemented and cementless types, each offering distinct advantages. Cemented prostheses utilize a bone-cement interface, providing immediate stability and fixation, making them suitable for patients with compromised bone quality. In contrast, cementless prostheses promote biological fixation through a porous surface, allowing for bone ingrowth. This type is often preferred for younger, more active patients as it may enhance longevity and reduce the risk of loosening over time. Both options cater to varying patient needs and clinical scenarios.</p></p>
